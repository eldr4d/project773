# Project 773

In this project we will try to classify Twitter users as schizophrenic or not.

# Data initialization
Extract the tar file and move all the files from the data/clpsych2015/schizophrenia inside the input folder.
In order to get all the tweets in python call the get_tweets() function from the read_tweets.py file. Keep in mind that we discard a lot of information from the actual data files.

# For LDA and Pennebaker features:
Download the file Prof. Resnik links below (LIWC2007_updated.dic) and place it in the ./input dir.
